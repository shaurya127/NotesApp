This is My NotesApp which i created using pure javascrip and bootstrap.I used concept of localStorage to store Notes in User browser.
The localStorage properties allow to save key/value pairs in a web browser.
The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.
